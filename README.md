# Report Vine Designer

Hitachi Vantara, the Pentaho Reporting developers, decided to [change the License](https://github.com/pentaho/pentaho-reporting/commit/77196da78f3c76605536d12944220b5a29d25f6d)
of Pentaho Reporting from LGPL to BSL - a change that we do not agree with.
Unfortunately, Pentaho Reporting seems not be heavily patronized in the industry so 
this change went about silently.

This is a fork of the last "truly free" Pentaho Report Designer codebase before the license
change, to preserve the Open Source nature and in future may represent a new
direction for the project.

We aim to rename the project and packages while keeping the sources intact and to avoid any copyright/trademark issues

In the mean time nstructions for working with the code are preserved in [README.old.md](README.old.md)
